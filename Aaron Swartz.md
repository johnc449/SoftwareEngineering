I have decided to write my essay about Aaron Swartz, a software engineer famous for co-authoring RSS 1.0 and Markdown, co-founding Reddit and playing an instrumental role in the campaign for a free and open Internet.

Swartz was born in Highland Park, an affluent suburb in Chicago. His father was the breadwinner of the family and worked as a computer consultant. From a young age his parents recognised his intelligence and luckily his home was one of the first in the area to have Internet access. He started off building websites for himself and his family but his first project which made him stand out came at the age of thirteen. Swartz developed the website The Info Network, which was an online encyclopaedia which anyone can edit, sound familiar? He won the ArsDigita Prize for this, months before Wikipedia launched.

At around the age of thirteen, Swartz&#39;s began to connect online with adults with similar interests to him. They understood he could be immature and could even come across as aggressive at times, but they recognised how talented he was and his unique aptitude for communicating ideas clearly. Swartz&#39;s first message to the rdfweb-dev group was _&quot;Hello everyone, I&#39;m Aaron. I&#39;m not \_that\_ much of a coder, (and I don&#39;t know much Perl) but I do think what you&#39;re doing is pretty cool, so I thought I&#39;d hang out here and follow along (and probably pester a bit).&quot;_ Many of the of the people he was talking to were part of the Semantic Web movement, a push to the make Internet data machine-readable, this most likely influenced Swartz thinking.

When Swartz turned fourteen, he joined a working group devoted to RSS. RDF Site Summary, the first version for RSS, was released by Netscape in 1999 but was soon abandoned. After this it became maintained by tinkerers online who believed in the format. They had split into two camps before Swartz came along. Swartz, of course, joined the camp aligned with the Semantic Web. It is commonly said that Swartz created or co-created RSS, he didn&#39;t. He was part of a splinter group that created RSS 1.0, a relatively unpopular version of RSS. Nevertheless, Swartz&#39;s contributions were real and mattered. I would love to have been a fly on the wall when his collaborators learned Swartz was a teenager!

Swartz also played a large role in the launch of Creative Commons, helping oversee the metadata implementation. A contractor on the project described him as &quot;extremely talented software engineer who just happens to be fourteen and wearing a T-shirt that&#39;s three sizes too big for him&quot;. Working with Swartz could often prove to be difficult because of his incredibly high standards, the same contractor says &quot;he was very critical of my work and he said so publicly. The guy was pretty hard on me.&quot;

Between 2002 and 2004, he spent a lot of time attending and speaking at numerous conferences about emerging technologies and issues. He had finally found people that although they were years his senior, shared similar interests with him and he enjoyed their company. By eighteen, Swartz had already been involved in countless large and small projects and probably was more experienced than most graduate software engineers. But Swartz was turning eighteen, the world now expected him to go to college and in the summer of 2004, he enrolled at Stanford University.

Stanford was not what Swartz chalked it up to be, he was disappointed that not everyone was on a mission to change the world. He realised that most of his peers just wanted to complete their work in college and go home, few had interest in the technical and philosophical conversation which Swartz craved. He switched from Computer Science to Sociology before dropping out at the end of First Year.

Swartz took the first exit he could find, an entrepreneur called Paul Graham, who&#39;d founded a start-up accelerator company named Y-Combinator. This was company was fresh on the scene at the time in 2005 but would go on to launch household names such as Stripe, Airbnb, Reddit, and Twitch. Swartz&#39;s pitch was an idea called Infogami, a platform which would help people build structured, rich, and visually interesting websites. It stemmed from his Semantic Web work previously and was a collaboration with a young Danish programmer named Simon Carstensen.

Infogami was a failure. Swartz had little experience building something so ambitious from scratch and had trouble attracting investors. Swartz and Carstensen also did not make great partners. As part of this work, Swartz created the web.py web application framework because he didn&#39;t find the other available systems in Python practical. Eventually Carstensen went home to Denmark, leaving Swartz alone. He began helping co-founders of another Y-Combinator form, Reddit, to rewrite its Lisp codebase using Python and web.py. Although Infogami&#39;s platform was semi abandoned at this time, its software was used to support Internet Archive&#39;s Open Library and the web.py framework was used as a basis for many other projects by Swartz and numerous others.

After Infogami began to run out of funding, Paul Graham attempted to solve this problem by merging Reddit and Infogami under an umbrella company. Swartz was given the title of co-founder of Reddit and the plan was for Steve Huffman(another Reddit co-founder) to help Swartz with his project while Swartz would help Reddit, both relying on the same web.py backend. This arrangement while initially optimistic was disastrous as Swartz grew sick of working on Reddit while Huffman did no work on Infogami. Nonetheless, Reddit began to make sizeable gains in popularity between 2005 and 2006. Eventually it was bought by Cond√© Nast(owner of Wired magazine) for an undisclosed sum and the money was divided between the relevant parties such as Graham, Huffman and Swartz. Carstensen also received a cut as gratitude for his early work on Infogami.

Reddit moved to San Francisco and Swartz begrudgingly moved with them. He hated corporate life and proved to be capricious and unproductive, writing blog posts critical of his co-workers and taking surprise trips to Europe. This was Swartz struggling to adapt to his new environment and choosing to deal with it the only way he knew how, to separate himself from it. Eventually Swartz was fired and he went to work on another start-up, Jottit, with his old friend Simon Carstensen.

Slowly, the projects that he was taking on moved to the intersection between data and governance. Swartz, an ardent copyright reformist, soon realised the usefulness of his programming and data gathering skills if applied directly to politics. He helped found a group called the Progressive Change Campaign Committee and afterwards started a site called Watchdog.net, which gathered information about voting records and campaign finances and gave its users the tools to dissect the data themselves. Swartz soon placed his eyes on a greater goal, PACER, the electronic storehouse for federal court records.

PACER records are public but it costed 8c per page to access them. Carl Malamud, founder of the non-profit group Public.Resource.Org, contended they should be free because federal documents could not be copyrighted. Malamud issued a call for action and in response Swartz used a Perl script running on Amazon cloud servers to download 2.7 million federal court documents to release to Public.Resource.org. The FBI investigated as Swartz had used stolen credentials from a library in Sacramento, but they decided not to file charges.

After this Swartz continued to be a huge voice in Internet Activism and was involved in the opposition to the Stop Online Piracy Act, which sought to combat Internet Copyright Violations but was regarded as impractical and draconian towards web sites and Internet providers. Swartz won this battle and the bill was scrapped. He said &quot;We won this fight because everyone made themselves the hero of their own story. Everyone took it as their job to save this crucial freedom&quot;.

On September 24th 2010, Swartz bought an Acer laptop computer and went to MIT with it, marking the beginning of the end. He planned to download as many documents as he could from JSTOR, an academic journal database. It is a paid service, containing mostly copyrighted content with many colleges paying as much as $50,000 dollars per year for access to it. Swartz made some efforts to conceal his tracks but would most likely have known the script he was using would catch the attention of JSTOR. JSTOR noticed and took a range of measures eventually shutting down all access to MIT temporarily. Undefeated, Swartz ceased his downloading for about a month but came back with plans to physically connect his computer somewhere in the MIT network to get more files. After connecting his computer in an unused storage closet, he left while it downloaded more documents, bringing his download count close to five million. Unknown to Swartz, a camera had been set up in the cupboard precisely to catch him.

Hours after last visiting the cupboard, Swartz was apprehended by police and Secret Service agents on campus. A few months later, in July 2011, he was indited on multiple counts including computer and wire fraud. The American government were making clear that they planned to make an example out of Swartz as more charges were added and negotiations for a plea deal ended in stalemate. The eccentric programmer from Chicago was now looking at a 35-year sentence in a federal prison. JSTOR, the most wronged party in this incident, declined to press charges but the government proceeded with the case against him. On Wednesday January 10th another plea deal bargain fell through with Swartz. He was facing up to 50 years imprisonment and 1 million in fines at this point but was offered a 6month sentence if he made a deal and pled guilty. Swartz refused to do this as he didn&#39;t view himself as a felon and certainly didn&#39;t want to get labelled as one.

The next day he went out for dinner with friends and was described as jovial and outgoing. A day later Swartz&#39;s body was found in his Brooklyn apartment, he had died by suicide. Software Engineering boasts many fascinating people from a diverse range of backgrounds but few of them we can call a Martyr, I would call Aaron Swartz one. His perfectionist approach to software engineering, stubborn nature and compulsion to build things reminds us all of someone we know or have worked with before. What makes him unique is the cost he paid for standing up for freedom and fairness. As Tim Berners-Lee said in Swartz&#39;s eulogy, Aaron saw &quot;coding as one way to change the world&quot;.
